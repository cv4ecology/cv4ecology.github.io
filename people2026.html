										<h4>Sara Beery</h4>
								        <p class="bio">
								        	Sara Beery has always been passionate about the natural world, and she saw a need for technology-based approaches to conservation and sustainability challenges. This led her to pursue a PhD at Caltech, where her research focuses on computer vision for global-scale biodiversity monitoring. Her work is funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a PIMCO Data Science Fellowship, and an Amazon AI4Science Fellowship. She works closely with Microsoft AI for Earth and Wildlife Insights (via Google Research) to translate her work into usable tools. Sara’s experiences as a professional ballerina, a queer woman, and a nontraditional student have taught her the value of unique and diverse perspectives in the research community. She’s passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM through mentorship, teaching, and outreach.

										<h4>Eric Orenstein</h4>
								        <p class="bio">
											Eric’s work lives at the intersection of ecology and computer vision, enabling unique studies of rapidly fluctuating marine environments. He uses imagery to study marine population dynamics, how they are impacted by their environment, and how they in turn influence the rest of the ecosystem. Eric has built and maintained imaging devices; worked with autonomous and remotely operated vehicles; executed field programs as a diver, small boat operator, and scientist aboardlarge research vessels; and used the data to study diverse organisms, from plankton to fish. Eric spends lots of time thinking about how to get robots to do useful things based on populations changes they encounter while underway.
